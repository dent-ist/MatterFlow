# UX mockups

Clickable, self-contained HTML mockups (mock data, no build, no network). Open by double-clicking. They change no product code.

## Dashboard (`dashboard-mockup.html`)

Screenshots: `screenshots/dashboard-*.png` (1366, 1920, 768, 375; tabs; empty, loading and technician states).
Deep links for review: `dashboard-mockup.html#opt=B&tab=users&state=empty&role=tech`.

### What it is
The app shell (LPT Hub, navy rail, top bar) around a redesigned Dashboard. Mock data: 4 clients, 8 matters, 60 tasks, 8 people, dates around 2026-10-29.
The small "Mockup" button (bottom right) switches the design option, the state (live, empty, loading) and the viewer (Director, or Technician who only sees the unassigned queue, as `Dashboard.ViewUnassigned` does today).

### Three first-screen options (Summary tab)
- **A, What is late**: three large tiles (Overdue, Due in 2 days, Unassigned) that double as the switch for one task list below; ASAP, On hold, Open, Completed are demoted to a quiet "Also on your radar" list; "What changed" is a short feed. Order = what is late, what is next, what changed.
- **B, Client and matter story**: Client cards, then the matters of that client in a sortable table, then results for the chosen scope as three tabs (late, next, changed). Clicking a card or a row drives the same Client then Matter filters.
- **C, Executive summary**: one plain sentence ("3 of 8 matters have overdue work"), four big KPIs with change vs last week, matters ranked by risk, a small created-vs-completed chart. Best for a Director who wants no list.

All options keep the five tabs (Summary, Breakdowns, Trends, Swimlane, Users), the period control, drill-down ("Open in Tasks"), a task drawer from any row, sortable headers, and the Users Workload/Coverage views.

### What was removed or demoted from today's page
- The separate Needs attention and Overview tile blocks (8 equal tiles) became 3 large tiles plus a quiet radar list; the period control now sits in the filter bar, not inside the Overview heading.
- Three lists (Unassigned, Overdue, Due soon) shown at once became one list that you switch with the tiles. Rows are one line (44 px).
- Per-row inline assignee drop-downs and "Created today" text left the list (assign from the drawer, or "Assign to me" for technicians).
- The Refresh tooltip text became one visible "Updated 09:42".
- Swimlane shows 4 cards per lane with "show more"; the filter strip is two controls.

### Colour meaning
Red = overdue, act now. Amber = at risk (due in 2 days, watch). Blue = information and primary actions (ASAP, open). Teal = healthy or done. Violet = needs a person (unassigned). Slate = neutral or waiting (on hold, empty). Colour is always paired with an icon and a word; text colours are at least 4.5:1 on their tint. A zero in Overdue, Due soon or Unassigned turns teal ("All clear").

### Things to try
Pick a Client, then watch the Matter list narrow; pick a Matter first and the Client follows. Click each tile. Sort a column, "Show all". Click a row (drawer; Esc closes). Switch Period. Breakdowns: click a task type to filter. Trends: toggle the legend chips. Users: Workload/Coverage, Cards/Table. Switch to Technician and press "Assign to me". Try the empty and loading states, and resize the window.

### Open questions
1. Should ASAP get a hero tile (it is only in the radar here)? The round-3 review flagged ASAP as invisible.
2. Is "Due in 2 days" (today's definition) the right window, or should it be 7?
3. Should On hold stay slate (neutral) or count as amber attention?
4. Which option should be the default, and should it depend on role (Director C, Project Manager B, Pod Lead A)?
5. Client health uses overdue counts only (3+ for a client, 2+ for a matter); is that the right rule?
6. The Matter filter shows all matters grouped by client when no client is chosen; is that clearer than disabling it?
7. Keyboard shortcuts were not touched (phase rule); the mockup only has Ctrl K for search.
